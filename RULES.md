### 1. Submission Modifications.
Draft Submissions: Prior to the end of the Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your Submission on AccelerateSF.org to your portfolio before submitting the Submission materials to the Hackathon for evaluation. Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your Submission.

Modifications: After the Submission Period. The Sponsor and AccelerateSF.org may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor and AccelerateSF.org permits. 

 
### 2. Judges & Criteria.
Eligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 

- Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

- Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

1. Technical Implementation: Does the project demonstrate quality software development? Does the project implement OIDC at a minimum? Did it implement SCIM? What AI framework(s) was implemented?

2. Design: Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?

3. Potential Readiness: How well prepared is the project to be integrated into the enterprise? 

4. Quality of the Idea: How creative and unique is the project?


The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

**Tie Breaking**. For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.

 
### 3. Intellectual Property Rights.
All Submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them. 

By entering the Hackathon, you grant to the Sponsor, Administrator, and any other third parties acting on the Sponsor’s behalf, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide perpetual license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes the Submission, in perpetuity. This license includes, but is not limited to, the marketing, or promotion of on Sponsor’s, Administrator’s, and partners’ products or services, posting or linking to the Submission on Sponsor’s, Administrator’s, and partners’ websites and applications, including the Hackathon Website, and display and promotion of the Submission in any other media, worldwide. By entering you acknowledge that the Sponsor, Administrator, or partner may have developed or commissioned materials similar or identical to your Submission and you waive any claims resulting from any similarities of such materials to your entry. Further you understand that the Sponsor, Administrator or partner will not restrict work assignments of representatives who have had access to your Submission and you agree that use of information in their representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of their products or services does not create liability for us under this agreement or copyright or trade secret law.

By submitting an entry, entrants agree that the Sponsor will have a fully paid, non-exclusive license to use such entry for judging the entry. Some Submission components may be displayed to the public. Other Submission materials may be viewed by the sponsor, AccelerateSF.org, and judges for screening and evaluation. By submitting a Submission or accepting any prize, Entrants represent and warrant that (a) submitted content is not copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless Entrant is the owner of such rights or has permission from their rightful owner to post the content; and (b) the content submitted does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware or other disabling devices or harmful or malicious code.

Furthermore, by virtue of the information's status as public domain, any solution devised during the hackathon shall also enter the public domain, hereby nullifying and rendering void any claim to intellectual property rights thereon.
