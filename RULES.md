### 2. Judges & Criteria.
Eligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”).

Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 

- Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

- Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

1. Technical Implementation: Does the project demonstrate quality software development? Does the project implement OIDC at a minimum? Did it implement SCIM? What AI framework(s) was implemented?

2. Design: Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?

3. Potential Readiness: How well prepared is the project to be integrated into the enterprise? 

4. Quality of the Idea: How creative and unique is the project?


The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

**Tie Breaking**. For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.

 
### 3. Intellectual Property Rights.
All Submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.

Further you understand that the Sponsor, Administrator or partner will not restrict work assignments of representatives who have had access to your Submission and you agree that use of information in their representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of their products or services does not create liability for us under this agreement or copyright or trade secret law.
