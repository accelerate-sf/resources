https://github.com/accelerate-sf/building_codes
* [1]  Build ontology of codes applicable to area of inquiry (categorical)
* [2] Creating schema across the categories 
* [3] Identify collisions in the code overlap, as a map
* [4] Use the categorical collisions consider dimensional  masking.


https://github.com/accelerate-sf/transparency
* [1] Classify laws and build an index of the various actions via extraction
* [2] Use LLM to extract keyword classification, into a tag cloud
* [3] Create a matrix, linking the public servant to identified laws that granular level
